# 99 Bottles

## Objective

Refactor `ninety_nine_bottles.rb` so that there are no functions which
have more than 5 lines in them.

## Requirements

- Each function has a maximum of 5 lines.
- The output of the `sing` function is unchanged.

## Testing

There is a test script called `test.rb`. When this script is run on the
command line with no arguments, it will tell you whether the current
`sing` function prints the same output as it originally did.

`test.rb` can be run either with

    $ ruby test.rb

or with

    $ ./test.rb
